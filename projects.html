        <h1>In the Beginning</h1>
        <p>From an early age, I showed a propensity for solving puzzles and for creating Lego structures that had little resemblance to the pictures on the boxes. However, it wasn't until my first exposure to computer science, at Sensoray's summer internship program for high school students, that I found a way to put those preoccupations to practical use. My joyful discovery that programming is all about creating solutions and solving puzzles led me to embark upon an exploration of computer science at Stanford.</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I've been involved with both personal and school software projects. Several of those projects involved front- or back-end web development. Some web sites, like this one and my sorority's (Chi Omega), I created from scratch. Others involved team efforts. For example, I collaborated on a major web restructuring at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sensoray.net">Sensoray</a> and did back-end and offline database work at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinrose.com">Pinrose</a>. On the other hand, some of my school projects, as well as the remote controlled jellybean dispenser I helped develop at Sensoray, were more focused on GUIs and the nuts and bolts of software.</p>
