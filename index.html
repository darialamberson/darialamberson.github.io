			    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my website.</h1>
			    <p>Dancing, singing, and programming might seem an unlikely combination of passions in one person, yet those are indeed the things I'm passionate about. I am an award-winning dancer and singer, an enthusiastic musical theater performer and a focused software designer. My name is Daria Lamberson, and I recently graduated from Stanford University. I studied Computer Science with a concentration in Information (Natural Language Processing and databases) and, when time permits, I express myself through performance art. And in case you want to know silly things about me, I love small black puppies and painting my nails (but not at the same time).</p>
			    
			    <h2>Dance and Gymnastics</h2>
			    <p>I began training at Westside Dance and Gymnastics Academy of Tigard, Oregon, at age six. Over the course of my twelve years there, I trained extensively in a variety of dance genres including acrobatic, ballet, jazz, modern, and tap, as well as artistic gymnastics. On a parallel track, I trained in RAD ballet technique and attended summer intensives at San Francisco Ballet and the School of American Ballet in New York City. Along the way, I earned a national dance title, more than a dozen regional dance titles, and a state gymnastics title.</p>
			    <p>Acro and ballet are my favorite dance styles. I have performed the <i>Grand Pas de Deux</i> several times, as well as <i>Snow Pas de Deux</i> and other principal roles, at annual Nutcracker ballets. I also danced with the NW Fusion Dance Company from its inception in 2008 until 2012, when I entered college.</p>
			    
			    <h2>Voice and Theater</h2>
			    <p>I joined the Stanford Harmonics <i>a cappella</i> group in my freshman year at Stanford. Prior to that, I was a member of Wilsonville High School's "Soul'd Out" <i>a cappella</i> group for three years, performing with them on NBC's prime time show <i>The Sing-Off</i> and at venues ranging from local community concerts to ICHSA national competitions. I have been a soprano soloist in Handel's Messiah and a member of both the Oregon All-State Honor Choir and the All-Northwest Honor Choir.</p>
			    <p>Musical theater credits include WHS productions of <i>Guys & Dolls</i> (Sarah Brown), <i>Les Mis√©rables</i> (Cosette), <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> (Dance Captain; Chorus), and segments of <i>Night on Broadway</i>, including <i>Phantom of the Opera's</i> "Think of Me" (Christine) and <i>Chicago's</i> "Cell Block Tango" (Hunyak), which involved dancing en pointe while speaking Hungarian.</p>
			    
			    <h2>Academics and Computer Science</h2>
			    <p>Academic pursuits have always been a top priority for me. In high school, I was a straight-A student, a Commended Student in the National Merit Scholarship Program and an AP Scholar with Distinction. My AP coursework included Physics B, Chemistry, and my favorites, Calculus AB and BC.</p>
			    <p>My college experience began as a resident at Stanford's Summer Engineering Academy during summer, 2012. Since then I have focused on mastering a broad spectrum of computer science topics, though I'm especially fond of database and web programming. I'm currently seeking opportunities in junior product management, so feel free to reach out if you have openings there.</p>
